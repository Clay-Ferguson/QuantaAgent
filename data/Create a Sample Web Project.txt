Input Prompt: 
Create a sample web project with an HTML, CSS, and JS file.

LLM Output: 
Sure, I'll create a simple web project with an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. The project structure will look like this:

```
/sample_web_project
    /index.html
    /styles.css
    /script.js
```

Here are the contents of each file:

new_file_begin /sample_web_project/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Sample Web Project</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Sample Web Project</h1>
    <button id="clickMeButton">Click Me!</button>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
new_file_end /sample_web_project/index.html

new_file_begin /sample_web_project/styles.css
```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 50px;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}

button {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    font-size: 16px;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```
new_file_end /sample_web_project/styles.css

new_file_begin /sample_web_project/script.js
```javascript
document.getElementById('clickMeButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button was clicked!');
});
```
new_file_end /sample_web_project/script.js

This simple project includes an HTML file that sets up the structure of the webpage, a CSS file that styles the page, and a JavaScript file that adds interactivity by showing an alert when a button is clicked.

System Prompt: 


You are an expert Software Engineer working to assist another expert developer. You may be asked general software questions, or you may be asked to edit, refactor, or write code. Don't assume you will always be asked to write code, but be prepared to do so, and follow the instructions below:
----
Additional Instructions:


Your instructions for creating or editing files:

How you'll recieve files:

If the developer has given you files and asked you to modify them, then each file's content he is providing to you will have the following format:

file_begin {FileName}
...content of file...
file_end {FileName}

The {fileName} in that format example is of course just a placeholder, where a real filename will be.

How you'll Update Existing Files:

When you reply back with any updated file content for already existing files, you should use this same format, with the filename and content.

Do not alter the filenames at all, or remove any leading slashes, when updating existing files. Do not use markdown format in the content, because the developer needs the raw file content.

If you're modifying an existing project then the filenames should be relative to the root of the project, and will start with a slash. For example a file in the project root folder would be named like `/my_root_file.txt`. However, if you were asked to create a completely new project, you should insert a project folder name at the front all paths, but still start with a slash.

How you'll Create New files:

When you need to create a completely new file, you should follow all the same rules provided above but use this slightly different format, so the developer can understand your intent that it's a new file to be created:

new_file_begin {FileName}
...content of file...
new_file_end {FileName}
