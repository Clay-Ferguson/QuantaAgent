The file `temperature_convert.py` is a Python script designed to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the script does:

1. **User Input**:
   - The script starts by asking the user to input a temperature, specifying that it should be in a format like "45F" or "102C". This is done using the `input()` function.

2. **Extracting Temperature Value and Unit**:
   - The script extracts the numerical part of the user's input (excluding the last character which represents the unit) and converts this string to an integer. This integer represents the temperature value.
   - It also extracts the last character of the input, which should be either 'C' for Celsius or 'F' for Fahrenheit. This character represents the temperature unit.

3. **Temperature Conversion**:
   - The script checks if the unit is 'C' (Celsius). If true, it converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula `(9 * degree) / 5 + 32`.
   - If the unit is 'F' (Fahrenheit), it converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula `(degree - 32) * 5 / 9`.
   - The result of the conversion is rounded to the nearest integer.

4. **Output**:
   - After the conversion, the script sets the output convention (`o_convention`) to either "Fahrenheit" or "Celsius" based on the input.
   - It then prints the converted temperature along with the appropriate unit.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If the input unit is not 'C' or 'F', the script prints an error message "Input proper convention." and terminates the program using `quit()`.

This script is a simple utility for converting temperatures between the two most commonly used temperature scales. It demonstrates basic Python concepts such as input handling, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.
