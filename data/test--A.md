OpenAI Model Used: gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09

System Prompt: You are a helpful assistant.

Timestamp: 1715279177065

User Prompt: How many files exist in this project, and what type of file are they?

Content of the folder named test_project/utils (using file_begin and file_end tags to delimit the files):
        
file_begin /utils/add_numbers.py
# This program adds three numbers

num1 = 1.5
num2 = 6.3
num3 = 2.4

# Add three numbers
sum = num1 + num2 + num3

# Display the sum
print("The sum of {0}, {1}, and {2} is {3}".format(num1, num2, num3, sum))
file_end /utils/add_numbers.py


file_begin /utils/hello_world.py
# This program prints Hello, world!

print("Hello, world!")

file_end /utils/hello_world.py



If I have sent you individual file(s) and asked you to modify them, in the prompt text above,
then each file is delimited with `file_begin ${FileName}` and `file_end ${FileName}` tags, so you can see what the full content of each file is along with it's filename.
Note that the actual file content for each file begins on the next line AFTER the `file_begin` line, and ends on the line BEFORE the `file_end` line.

Please provide me with the new version(s) of the file(s) by using the following format, where you replace {new_content} with the new content of the file, and put the filename
in place of `FileName` without the `${}` tags. Do not alter the filenames at all, or remove any leading slashes. 

// file_begin FileName
{new_content}
// file_end FileName

If you didn't find it necessary to edit a file, you can just omit it from your response. 
If I wasn't asking you to modify any code at all don't include any file_begin or file_end blocks in your response.
