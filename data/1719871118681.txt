AI Response 1:
Sure, I'll refactor the `temperature_convert.py` file to implement the temperature conversion logic as a class. Here is the updated code:

```python
class TemperatureConverter:
    def __init__(self, temp):
        self.temp = temp
        self.degree = int(temp[:-1])
        self.i_convention = temp[-1].upper()

    def convert(self):
        if self.i_convention == "C":
            return self._celsius_to_fahrenheit()
        elif self.i_convention == "F":
            return self._fahrenheit_to_celsius()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Input proper convention.")

    def _celsius_to_fahrenheit(self):
        result = int(round((9 * self.degree) / 5 + 32))
        return result, "Fahrenheit"

    def _fahrenheit_to_celsius(self):
        result = int(round((self.degree - 32) * 5 / 9))
        return result, "Celsius"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    temp = input("Enter Temperature: ")
    converter = TemperatureConverter(temp)
    try:
        result, o_convention = converter.convert()
        print(f"The temperature in {o_convention} is {result} degrees.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
```

I'll now update the `temperature_convert.py` file with this new implementation.

The `temperature_convert.py` file has been successfully refactored to implement the temperature conversion logic as a class. Here is the updated content:

```python
class TemperatureConverter:
    def __init__(self, temp):
        self.temp = temp
        self.degree = int(temp[:-1])
        self.i_convention = temp[-1].upper()

    def convert(self):
        if self.i_convention == "C":
            return self._celsius_to_fahrenheit()
        elif self.i_convention == "F":
            return self._fahrenheit_to_celsius()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Input proper convention.")

    def _celsius_to_fahrenheit(self):
        result = int(round((9 * self.degree) / 5 + 32))
        return result, "Fahrenheit"

    def _fahrenheit_to_celsius(self):
        result = int(round((self.degree - 32) * 5 / 9))
        return result, "Celsius"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    temp = input("Enter Temperature: ")
    converter = TemperatureConverter(temp)
    try:
        result, o_convention = converter.convert()
        print(f"The temperature in {o_convention} is {result} degrees.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
```

System Prompt: 


You are an expert Software Engineer working to assist another expert developer. You may be asked general software questions, or you may be asked to edit, refactor, or write code. Don't assume you will always be asked to write code, but be prepared to do so, and follow the instructions below:
----
Additional Instructions:


Your instructions for receiving files:

<instructions>
If the developer has given you files and asked you to modify them, then each file's content he is providing to you will have the following format:

file_begin {FileName}
...content of file...
file_end {FileName}

The {fileName} in that format example is of course just a placeholder, where a real filename will be.

</instructions>

Your instructions for creating and updating files:

<instructions>
You will be given agent tools named create_file and update_file, which you can use to create new files and/or update the content of existing files.
</instructions>

Your instructions for how to Find Blocks of Code:

<instructions>
Notice that there may be sections in the prompt that are formatted like this:

block_begin {MyBlockName}
... content of a code block ...
block_end

In these prompt sections the {MyBlockName} slot holds the name of the code block (so you can uniquely identify the code block), and the content lines are below it, in between the block_begin line and block_end line. Note: The block name itself doesn't contain any curly braces.

</instructions>

Your instructions for how to update blocks of code:

<instructions>
You will be given a tool function named update_block, which you can use to update the content of named blocks as needed.
</instructions>
