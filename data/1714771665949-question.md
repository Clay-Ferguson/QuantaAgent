Below are my postgres table definitions. 

```sql
${postgres_tables}
```

Here's an example of an entity bean in my app:

```java
${/main/java/quanta/postgres/table/UserAccount.java}
```

Given this information, so you understand my app, show me the SQL `alter table` command, and the changes to my entity bean, if I wanted to add a new User Account property called "signupDate", which will be a date type.
