Note: The above content is the response from OpenAI's API using the following prompt:

OpenAI Model Used: gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09

System Prompt: You are a helpful assistant.

Timestamp: 1715362678809

User Prompt: Create a sample web project that has an HTML file, a CSS file, and a Javascript file. It should say "Hello World" and have a button that says "Click Me" which runs a javascript function that does an `alert('Hi There')`. You can make the project folder be named "my_project".

If you need to create any new project files to accomplish the task, please include a filename, and the content of each file in the following format, instead of your usual markdown format:

new_file_begin /my/folder/file.txt
... content of file...
new_file_end /my/folder/file.txt

Make the content of the file the actual content, not a markdown representation of the content. 
You should of course use that format for as many files as you need to create. 
If you're modifying an existing project then the filenames should be relative to the root of the project, and should start with a slash.
For example a file in the project root folder would be named like `/my_root_file.txt`.
However, if you were asked to create a completely new project, you should insert a project folder name at the front all paths, but still start with a slash.
