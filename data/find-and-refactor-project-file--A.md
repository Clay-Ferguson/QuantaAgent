Note: The above content is the response from OpenAI's API using the following prompt:

OpenAI Model Used: gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09

System Prompt: You are a helpful assistant.

Timestamp: 1715279600403

User Prompt: Find the file that adds numbers and make it add three instead of two numbers.

Below is the content of the files in the folder named test_project (using file_begin and file_end tags to delimit the files):
        
file_begin /temperature_convert.py
# Prompt the user to input a temperature in the format (e.g., 45F, 102C, etc.)
temp = input("Input the temperature you like to convert? (e.g., 45F, 102C etc.) : ")

# Extract the numerical part of the temperature and convert it to an integer
degree = int(temp[:-1])

# Extract the convention part of the temperature input (either 'C' or 'F')
i_convention = temp[-1]

# Check if the input convention is in uppercase 'C' (Celsius)
if i_convention.upper() == "C":
    # Convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit
    result = int(round((9 * degree) / 5 + 32))
    o_convention = "Fahrenheit"  # Set the output convention as Fahrenheit
# Check if the input convention is in uppercase 'F' (Fahrenheit)
elif i_convention.upper() == "F":
    # Convert the Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius
    result = int(round((degree - 32) * 5 / 9))
    o_convention = "Celsius"  # Set the output convention as Celsius
else:
    # If the input convention is neither 'C' nor 'F', print an error message and exit the program
    print("Input proper convention.")
    quit()

# Display the converted temperature in the specified output convention
print("The temperature in", o_convention, "is", result, "degrees.")

If I have sent you individual file(s) and asked you to modify them, in the prompt text above,
then each file is delimited with `file_begin ${FileName}` and `file_end ${FileName}` tags, so you can see what the full content of each file is along with it's filename.
Note that the actual file content for each file begins on the next line AFTER the `file_begin` line, and ends on the line BEFORE the `file_end` line.

Please provide me with the new version(s) of the file(s) by using the following format, where you replace {new_content} with the new content of the file, and put the filename
in place of `FileName` without the `${}` tags. Do not alter the filenames at all, or remove any leading slashes. 

// file_begin FileName
{new_content}
// file_end FileName

If you didn't find it necessary to edit a file, you can just omit it from your response. 
If I wasn't asking you to modify any code at all don't include any file_begin or file_end blocks in your response.
