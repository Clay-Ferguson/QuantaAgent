Here is the code to inject for adding a timestamp to the output:

```python
# inject_begin NewCodeHere
from datetime import datetime
print(f"This is a test block at {datetime.now()}")
# inject_end
```

Note: The above content is the response from OpenAI's API using the following prompt:

OpenAI Model Used: gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09

System Prompt: You are a helpful assistant.

Timestamp: 1715124337893

User Prompt: Add some code that does the same thing as this line but includes a timestamp in the output as well.

```py
print("This is a test block")
# block_inject NewCodeHere

```


If I was asking you to add some new code, in the prompt above, then to provide me with the new code, use the following strategy: 
Notice that there are sections named `// block_inject {Name}` in the code I gave you. 
I'd like for you to show me just what I need to insert into each of those `block_inject` sections of the code. 
So when you show code, show only the changes and show the changes like this format in your response:

// inject_begin {Name}
... the code to insert ...
// inject_end 

Note that the `//` in `// block_inject {Name}` is there becasue that example is for Java style comments; however, you may also find 
`-- block_inject {Name}` for SQL style comments, or `# block_inject {Name}` for Python style comments, and you will handle those also.
You may not need to inject into some of the `block_inject` locations. 
These `block_inject` points are just for you to refer to which places the code needs to be inserted, and to provide it back to me in a machine parsable way.

In the format example above, for the `inject_begin` and `inject_end` lines, I've given `//` as the comment prefix in the example, 
but you should use whatever comment prefix is appropriate based on the language (or file format) you're working with. 
If there's no comment prefix for the language, just use `//` for the prefix.
