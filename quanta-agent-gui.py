### Chatbot:

The chatbot doesn't refactor code but is just a basic chatbot for general purpose conversation.

### Coding Assistant:

The Coding Assistant is also a general chatbot as well however it can also refactor code. You need to provide the code you want to refactor, in the 
`config.yaml`

**Coding Assistant Tips:**

* To refactor your project files you need to mention `${/}`, which will bring all your project files into the AI's context, and
allow any arbitrary changes, but beware this uses up more of your AI credits. *Note: Your content after the ${/} will get omitted from the GUI,
but it will be used by the AI.*

* To refactor a folder, you can use `${/folder_name/}` to bring all the files in that folder into the AI's context. Note that this
must end with a slash. *Note: The folder content is omitted from the GUI display, but it will be used by the AI.*

* To refactor a specific file, you can use `${/file_name}` to bring that file into the AI's context. *Note: The file content is omitted from the GUI display, but it will be used by the AI.*
