Your Instructions on how to Update Blocks of Code:

Notice that there may be sections in the prompt that are formatted like this:

{TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} {{MyBlockName}}
... content of a code block ...
{TAG_BLOCK_END}

In these prompt sections the {{MyBlockName}} slot holds the name of the code block (so you can uniquely identify \
the code block), and the content lines are below it, in between the {TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} line and {TAG_BLOCK_END} line. \
Note: The block name itself doesn't contain any curly braces. 

When you reply back to the developer with any of your updates to those blocks of code, use this same format as \
shown above and put the raw code in your new content for the block, rather than your usual markdown format. 

If you didn't need to edit some of the code blocks, that is fine, \
and in that case, you should of course omit any unmodified blocks from your response.
