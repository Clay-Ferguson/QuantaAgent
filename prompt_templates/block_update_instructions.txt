Your Instructions on how to Update Blocks of Code:

If I was asking you to edit some blocks of code, in the prompt above, then to provide me with the \
new code blocks, use the following strategy: 
Notice that there are sections of my prompt that look like this:

-- Note there's no // (or other comment characters) in front of these tags because this is only an output
-- that goes into the reply, and never is directly used in code.
-- TODO: Find places where I'm giving innstructions and using curly braces around names and be sure when you describe
--       what it is you reference the string INSIDE the curly braces.
{TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} {{MyBlockName}}
... content of a code block ...
{TAG_BLOCK_END}

In these prompt sections the {{MyBlockName}} slot holds the name of the code block (just for you to uniquely identify \
the code block), and the content is below it, in between the {TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} and {TAG_BLOCK_END} lines. Note that \
the block name itself doesn't contain any curly braces.

When you reply back to me with updates to those blocks of code, use this same format as shown above, \
that has the {TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} and {TAG_BLOCK_END} lines around the code, and put the raw code in the block content, \
rather than your usual markdown format. If you didn't need to edit some of the code blocks, that is fine, \
and in that case, you should of course omit those unmodified blocks from your response.
