Your Instructions on how to Find Blocks of Code:

Notice that there may be sections in the prompt that are formatted like this:

{TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} {{MyBlockName}}
... content of a code block ...
{TAG_BLOCK_END}

In these prompt sections the {{MyBlockName}} slot holds the name of the code block (so you can uniquely identify \
the code block), and the content lines are below it, in between the {TAG_BLOCK_BEGIN} line and {TAG_BLOCK_END} line. \
Note: The block name itself doesn't contain any curly braces.

-- For AppConfig.tool_use==True and AppConfig.agentic==Ture use these instructions:
You will be given a tool function named update_block, which you can use to update block contant as needed.

-- NOTE: These instructions are not for use when AppConfig.tool_use==True and AppConfig.agentic==True
--       which are the new preferred settings. The reason is becasue when tools are used the LLM will
--       handle updating blocks thru the agent, rather than embedding into reply content.
-- #####################################################################################
-- When you reply back to the developer with any of your updates to those blocks of code, use this same format as \
-- shown above and put the raw code in your new content for the block, rather than your usual markdown format. 
--
-- If you didn't need to edit some of the code blocks, that is fine, \
-- and in that case, you should of course omit any unmodified blocks from your response.
