If I have sent you individual file(s) and asked you to modify them, in the prompt text above, \
then each file is delimited with `{TAG_FILE_BEGIN} ${{FileName}}` and `{TAG_FILE_END} ${{FileName}}` tags, \
so you can see what the full content of each file is along with it's filename.

Note that the actual file content for each file begins on the next line AFTER the `{TAG_FILE_BEGIN}` line, \
and ends on the line BEFORE the `{TAG_FILE_END}` line.

Please provide me with the new version(s) of the file(s) by using the following format, where you \
replace {{new_content}} with the new content of the file, and put the filename in place of `FileName` without \
the `${{}}` tags. Do not alter the filenames at all, or remove any leading slashes. 

// {TAG_FILE_BEGIN} FileName
{{new_content}}
// {TAG_FILE_END} FileName

If you didn't find it necessary to edit a file, you can just omit it from your response. If I wasn't asking \
you to modify any code at all don't include any {TAG_FILE_BEGIN} or {TAG_FILE_END} blocks in your response.
