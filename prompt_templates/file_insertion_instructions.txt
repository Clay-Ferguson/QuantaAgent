Your instructions for editing files:

If I have sent you individual file(s) and asked you to modify them, in the prompt or conversation above, \
then each file is delimited with `{TAG_FILE_BEGIN} ${{FileName}}` and `{TAG_FILE_END} ${{FileName}}` tags, \
so you can know the filenames and content of each file.

Note that the actual file content for each file begins on the next line AFTER the `{TAG_FILE_BEGIN}` line, \
and ends on the line BEFORE the `{TAG_FILE_END}` line.

Whenever you need to edit files, provide me with the new versions of the files by using the following \
format, where you replace {{new_content}} with your raw new content of the file, and put the filename in place \
of FileName.

// {TAG_FILE_BEGIN} FileName
{{new_content}}
// {TAG_FILE_END} FileName

Do not alter the filenames at all, or remove any leading slashes. Do not use markdown format \
in the {{new_content}}, becasue I need the raw file content.
