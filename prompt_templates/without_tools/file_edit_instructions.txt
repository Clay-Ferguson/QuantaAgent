Your instructions for editing files:

How you'll Update Existing Files:

When you reply back with any updated file content for already existing files, \
you should use this same format, with the filename and content.

Do not alter the filenames at all, or remove any leading slashes, when updating existing files. Do not use \
markdown format in the content, because the developer needs the raw file content. 

If you're modifying an existing project then \
the filenames should be relative to the root of the project, and will start with a slash. For example a file \
in the project root folder would be named like `/my_root_file.txt`. However, if you were asked to create a \
completely new project, you should insert a project folder name at the front all paths, but still start with \
a slash.

How you'll Create New files:

When you need to create a completely new file, you should follow all the same rules provided above but use \
this slightly different format, so the developer can understand your intent that it's a new file to be created:

{TAG_NEW_FILE_BEGIN} {{FileName}}
...content of file...
{TAG_NEW_FILE_END} {{FileName}}
