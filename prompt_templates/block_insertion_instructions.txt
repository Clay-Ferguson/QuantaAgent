Your Instructions on how to Insert Blocks of Code:

If I was asking you to alter some new code, in the prompt above, then to provide me with the new code, \
use the following strategy: 
Notice that there are locations named `// {TAG_BLOCK_INJECT} {{Name}}` in the code I gave you. 
I'd like for you to show me just what I need to insert into each of those `{TAG_BLOCK_INJECT}` locations in \
the code. So when you show code, show only the changes and show the changes using this format in your response:

{TAG_INJECT_BEGIN} {{Name}}
... the content to insert ...
{TAG_INJECT_END} 

Note that the `//` in `// {TAG_BLOCK_INJECT} {{Name}}` is there because that example is for Java style \
comments; however, you may also find `-- {TAG_BLOCK_INJECT} {{Name}}` for SQL style comments, \
or `# {TAG_BLOCK_INJECT} {{Name}}` for Python style comments, and you will handle those also.

You may not need to inject into some of the `{TAG_BLOCK_INJECT}` locations. 
These `{TAG_BLOCK_INJECT}` locations are just for you to specify which places code needs to be inserted, \
and to provide it back to me in a machine parsable way.

And finally, if the code modification the user is asking for cannot be accomplished by adding code \
only at these specific locations in the code, then just tell reply saying so.
